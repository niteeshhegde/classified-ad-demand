**Description**
This directory consists of Jupyter notebooks used for Machine Learning using Traditional ML algorithms, Apache Spark for larger data and tensorflow for large text data.

**Directory Structure**
- __ml-models__ : Machine Learning models run on Google Colab. Consists of 2 notebooks (Part 1 and Part 2) where part 1 has simple models and some simple ensemble algorithms while part 2 mainly has modelling using advanced boosting algorithms.
- __spark__ : Machine Learning using Apache Spark. It consists of 2 notebooks one for pre processing and the other for training on Random Forest using Pyspark.
- __tensorflow__ : This has two main approaches to handle text data using tensorflow, one with Transformers (rubert) and other using word2vec Russian embeddings. Word2Vec  produced the best results among BoW, Tf-Idf, transformers, etc while all low performing notebooks are note included here.
